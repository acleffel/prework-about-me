      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent 2020 graduate from Bowling Green State University with a bachelors in media production with a specialization in audio and video production, and a double minor in music industry and advertising.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Springfield Ohio</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a musician that plays a number of instruments with my main ones being piano, guitar, and bass. I work as a freelance music producer/audio engineer currently so I enjoy any time I can work on music production, mixing, mastering, and composition. If I am not doing something music related, I really enjoy reading, working out, learning new challenging things, and spending time with my wife and three cats. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Full stack web developer or touring musician.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Westerville, Ohio</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I struggled finding work after I graduated due to covid, and wanted to pursue a career path with more in demand skills as well as a much higher salary. My wife and I are also expecting our first child this Christmas (yes he is due on Christmas day) so I want to become a web developer to be able to better provide for my family and have a healthier work/life balance than I currently do.</p>
